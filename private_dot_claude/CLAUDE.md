## Development Practices

### Python
- Always use `/.venv` (not `/venv`)
- Test imports before complex implementations
- Test incrementally, not after everything is built

### Git Workflow
- Commit after completing each task step
- Push after committing, then verify no uncommitted changes
- Use descriptive commit messages

### MCP Usage
- Use Serena when available for semantic code retrieval
- Use Context7 for up-to-date third-party documentation
- Use Sequential Thinking for complex decisions

### General
- Read project CLAUDE.md before starting work
- Don't make assumptions on how to navigate sites
- Back up claims with evidence and official docs
